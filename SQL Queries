"We want to return co and name from CInfo if the
company has an invoice in SInvoice in the last 
6 months (use distinct since we don't want multiples).
I'll give you the next part when you get this. 
Use a formula to get six months ago instead of entering 
a manual date"

SELECT Distinct c.co, c.name
FROM Cinfo c, SInvoices s
WHERE s.invoiceDate > DATEADD(month, -6, GETDATE()) and s.co = c.co
